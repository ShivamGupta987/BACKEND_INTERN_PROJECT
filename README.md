## Project Overview

This project provides a RESTful API for managing users and admins. Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles, while admins have additional functionality like managing user data.

---

## Technologies

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **Express.js** – Framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing user and admin data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** – For handling secure authentication and authorization.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-backend.git
cd user-management-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Start the server:

Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be running on port `5000` (or the port specified in `.env`).

### 2. Create Super Admin (if not already created):

To create a Super Admin user, run:

```bash
node utils/createSuperAdmin.js
```
